# About GenHI
GenHI is an AI-powered solution that helps organizations run more efficiently. Its main function is to fetch data from project management platforms (such as Plane in this example)
and other tools used by employees in an organization, to provide multi-faceted summary about projects status to reduce the amount of "work-about-work" and focus human resources on productive tasks.

As per [Asana's Anatomy of Work Index](https://asana.com/resources/why-work-about-work-is-bad) 60% of employee time is lost in "work-about-work" tasks such as chasing updates, attending unnecessary meetings, and switching between tools.

This project is to empower the Human Intelligence to focus on productive tasks by the use of Artificial Intelligence to help in auxiliary tasks.
